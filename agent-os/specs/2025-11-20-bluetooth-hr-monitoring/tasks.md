      - Demo mode data flows through same pipeline as real device
  - [ ] 8.4 Perform manual testing checklist
    - Install on physical Android device
    - Grant Bluetooth and location permissions
    - Scan for devices (verify real HR monitor appears if available)
    - Connect to Demo Mode device
    - Verify large BPM display updates every 1-2 seconds
    - Verify color changes as simulated HR moves through zones
    - Verify chart scrolls smoothly showing last 30 seconds
    - Verify session statistics update in real-time
    - Change age in settings, verify zone colors update immediately
    - Change chart window, verify chart adjusts time range
    - Force disconnect (turn off device or go out of range)
    - Verify reconnection attempts display correctly
    - Let reconnection fail, verify dialog appears with options
    - Test on iOS device (if available)
    - Test on different screen sizes (phone, tablet)
  - [ ] 8.5 Polish UI details
    - Ensure all text is readable and properly sized
    - Verify color contrast ratios meet accessibility standards (WCAG AA)
    - Add smooth animations for BPM value changes (AnimatedSwitcher)
    - Add smooth color transitions for zone changes (AnimatedContainer)
    - Ensure chart renders smoothly without jank

    - Verify responsive layout on different screen sizes
    - Test landscape orientation
  - [ ] 8.6 Run feature-specific tests only
    - Run ONLY tests related to this spec's feature
    - Expected total: approximately 22-58 tests maximum
    - Do NOT run the entire application test suite (there isn't one yet)
    - Verify critical workflows pass
    - Run flutter analyze to check for linting issues
    - Fix any linting warnings or errors
  - [ ] 8.7 Create basic usage documentation
    - Update README.md with feature overview

    - Document required permissions (Bluetooth, Location on Android)
    - List supported platforms (Android, iOS minimum; others untested)
    - Note database encryption is enabled
    - Document dependencies added

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All feature-specific tests pass (approximately 22-58 tests total)
- Critical user workflows for this feature are covered
- No more than 10 additional tests added when filling in testing gaps
- Manual testing checklist completed successfully on at least one physical device
- UI is polished with smooth animations and transitions
- flutter analyze passes with no errors or warnings
- README.md documents the feature and usage instructions
- Feature is ready for real-world use

## Execution Notes

### Testing Strategy
This feature follows a focused, incremental testing approach:
- Each implementation task group (2-7) writes 2-8 focused tests covering critical behaviors only
- Tests run only for that specific task group, not the entire suite
- Final integration testing phase (Task Group 8) reviews existing tests and adds up to 10 additional strategic tests to fill critical gaps
- Total expected tests: approximately 22-58 tests maximum
- Focus on testing behavior and critical workflows, not implementation details

### Dependencies Management
- Task Groups 2-4 can be worked on in parallel after Task Group 1 completes
- Task Group 5 requires completion of Task Groups 2, 3, and 4
- Task Group 6 requires completion of Task Groups 3 and 5
- Task Group 7 requires completion of Task Groups 4, 5, and 6
- Task Group 8 requires completion of all previous task groups

### Development Tips
- Use hot reload extensively during UI development for rapid iteration
- Test with Demo Mode first before requiring physical BLE device
- Use flutter_blue_plus example app as reference for BLE implementation patterns
- Use fl_chart example app as reference for chart customization
- Keep database service as singleton to avoid multiple database instances
- Use Riverpod's ProviderObserver for debugging state changes during development
- Test on physical device early and often (BLE doesn't work in emulators)
- Consider using flutter_logs or similar for debugging BLE issues

### Platform-Specific Considerations
- **Android**: Location permission required for BLE scanning (OS requirement)
- **iOS**: Bluetooth permission required, add usage description to Info.plist
- **Web/Desktop**: BLE support limited or unavailable, focus on mobile platforms
- Test demo mode on all platforms, real BLE connection on mobile only

### Performance Considerations
- Database writes every 1-2 seconds: ensure writes are async and non-blocking
- Chart rendering: limit data points displayed to avoid performance issues
- BLE stream: ensure proper stream subscription cleanup to avoid memory leaks
- Riverpod providers: use .autoDispose where appropriate to clean up resources

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Historical session browsing UI
- Session export to CSV
- Custom heart rate zones (not age-based)
- Multiple device connections
- Advanced analytics (HRV, VO2 max)
- Workout planning and goal setting
- Audio/haptic feedback for zone changes
- Cloud backup and sync
